This code explores ways to plot and assess the supplementary data from DOI: 10.1126/science.abk2066

Please use it as you see fit. For our purposes, I have created a "Of Interset" Section to help our team to visualize genes that we care about it see how they behave in the various contexts that explored in the paper.

To update the list of genes, simply copy the Google Colab notebook and edit the line  by putting your gene in single quotes and lowercase: 

if gene in ['dksa', 'rpob', 'mreb', 'rodz', 'crp', 'rsd']: return 'Of Interest'

Cheers!
